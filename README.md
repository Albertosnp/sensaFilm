## üóÑÔ∏è Architecture

The architecture used is [Bulletproof React](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react)


## About Redux

Redux has not been used because, as the app is designed, states are managed locally. Even so, it is prepared so that when it is decided to scale, it can be implemented in a clean way.

## Daily usage and deploying

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

To install the dependencies

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
